            Hello! There are many user inputs in this model of the Solar System. Press "Pause and Play
            to pause and play the animation. Enter an angle value integer in degrees into the input box and press submit to change the speed of rotation.
            Higher values will spin the the entire model faster counterclockwise. Lower values will spin the entire model faster clockwise.
            There are also keyboard and mouse inputs as well. Pressing left on the keyboard will spin the entire model clockwise. Pressing right
            on the keyboard will spin the model faster counterclockwise. Clicking on the canvas with the left mouse button, moving the cursor with the left mouse button held down
            and releasing the left mouse button within the canvas will move the planetary system towards the cursor. It will not move the spacecraft. To move the spacecraft press 
            the up arrow key to accelerate it towards the left and the down arry key to accelerate it towards the right. There is also a planet that starts out as a dot and grows 
            through time until it reaches a certain size. Enjoy!
        </p>
